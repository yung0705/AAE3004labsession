# Autonomous-Car-Control-Project
Hello everyone!
This repository is made for any discussions and sharing of codes for our autonomous car project. 
In this project, you are expected to alter the ROS car's PID controller by accessing the car's STM32 source code.
Attached, you can find several manuals and codes to help guide you through the project.

Though the manuals give you the essentials of what is required from the project, you are expected explore the car's functions on your own!


# Important Tips
1. Please confirm that the cable connection of the newly received car is not loose
2. Please confirm that all two switch on the side of the car is 'on' when you conduct the test
